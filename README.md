Use of the freeware R for general data handling, plotting and statistical data mining.

The whole repository can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/low-decarie/R-for-biologists/archive/master.zip). This is the same as clicking on `Clone or download` then `Download zip` on this github page.

This repository includes the following sub-folders:

* Data : data files
* Instructions : documents accompanying day 3-5 lectures.  Available as PDF, HTML and/or word.  These documents are created in R using markdown (hence the .Rmd that can be open directly in RStudio).
* my\_R\_scripts: an empty folder in which to save your scripts created in the module
* Output: where the output of your scripts should go
* Plots: where the figures you produce should go
* Presentations: contains the presentation (as pptx, PDF or links to online html presentations)
* R: contains scripts already written for the exercises. try writing your own before running these.

This is also an example folder structure useful for staying organized when working on an R project. [You can set up a similar structure automaticly.](http://etiennelowdecarie.org/2014/02/08/r-project-setup-folder-structure-2/)
